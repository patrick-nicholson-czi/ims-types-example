                an ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 [ISO 3166-1] country code in uppercase,
                separated by a dash. For example, en-US or fr-CA. As a
                compatibility note, some implementations have used an underscore
                as the separator rather than a dash, for example, en_US; Tools
                MAY choose to accept this locale syntax as well.
