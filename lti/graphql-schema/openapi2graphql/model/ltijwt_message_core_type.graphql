type LtijwtMessageCoreType {

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the token. The iss value is a case sensitive URL using the https scheme that contains scheme, host, and optionally, port number and path components and no query or fragment components.
  iss: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. A locally unique and never reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which is intended to be consumed by the Client, e.g., 24400320 or AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4. It MUST NOT exceed 255 ASCII characters in length. The sub value is a case sensitive string.
  sub: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for. It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the tool provider. It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences. In the general case, the aud value is an array of case sensitive strings. In the common special case when there is one audience, the aud value MAY be a single case sensitive string.
  aud: [String!]

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; Integer. Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of this parameter requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the value. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time. See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.
  exp: Int!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; Integer. Time at which the JWT was issued. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.
  iat: Int!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. Authorized party - the party to which the ID Token was issued. If present, it MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 Client ID of this party.
  azp: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.
  nonce: String!

  # This required attribute indicates the version of LTI to which the message conforms.

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. This required attribute contains a string that defines the platform-tool integration governing the message.
  https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/claim/deployment_id: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. End-User&#39;s full name in displayable form including all name parts, possibly including titles and suffixes, ordered according to the End-User&#39;s locale and preferences.
  name: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. Given name(s) or first name(s) of the End-User. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple given names; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.
  given_name: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. Surname(s) or last name(s) of the End-User. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple family names or no family name; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.
  family_name: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. Middle name(s) of the End-User. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple middle names; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters. Also note that in some cultures, middle names are not used.
  middle_name: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. URL of the End-User&#39;s profile picture. This URL MUST refer to an image file (for example, a PNG, JPEG, or GIF image file), rather than to a Web page containing an image. Note that this URL SHOULD specifically reference a profile photo of the End-User suitable for displaying when describing the End-User, rather than an arbitrary photo taken by the End-User.
  picture: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. End-User&#39;s preferred e-mail address. Its value MUST conform to the RFC 5322 [RFC 5322] addr-spec syntax. The Tool MUST NOT rely upon this value being unique.
  email: String!

  # Model Primitive Datatype &#x3D; String. End-User&#39;s locale, represented as a BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag. This is typically an ISO 639-1 Alpha-2 [ISO 639-1] language code in lowercase and an ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 [ISO 3166-1] country code in uppercase, separated by a dash. For example, en-US or fr-CA. As a compatibility note, some implementations have used an underscore as the separator rather than a dash, for example, en_US; Tools MAY choose to accept this locale syntax as well.
  locale: String!
